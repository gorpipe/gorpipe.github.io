  GORpipe is a tool based on a genomic ordered relational architecture 
  and allows analysis of large sets of genomic and phenotypic tabular 
  data using a declarative query language, in a parallel execution engine. 
  It is very efficient in a wide range of use-cases, including genome wide 
  batch analysis, range-queries, genomic table joins of variants and segments, 
  filtering, aggregation etc. The query language combines ideas from SQL and 
  Unix shell pipe syntax, supporting seek-able nested queries, materialized 
  views, and a rich set of commands and functions. For more information see 
  the paper in Bioinformatics.
